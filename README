tl is a command-line utility for generating a tracklist given a directory
containing an album in FLAC format.

To use tl, you must have bash installed and located at /bin/bash (or edit the
'shebang' line to point where you have bash installed). You also must have flac
installed and in your path as tl uses the metaflac command.

In general, usage follows the form:
./tl.sh [options] /path/to/directory/

The default use of tl requires no options, i.e.
./tl.sh /path/to/directory

The only current option is to display the total length of an album:
./tl.sh -t /path/to/directory

There are a few "User-defined Variables" at this point; they are found at the
top of the script:
sep:
    The separator between the track number and the track title. There is no 
    whitespace present, so that must be included. Defaults to " - ".
no & nc:
    The opening and closing BBCode to apply to the track number. It can be left
    empty. Defaults to bolding.
display_length:
    Whether or not to display track length at the end of the tracklist. Must be
    changed to 1 (true) if you wish to make use of the -t option. Defaults to 0
    (false).
to & tc:
    The opening and closing BBCode to apply to the track length. It can be left
    empty. Defaults to italics.
